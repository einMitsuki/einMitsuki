Hey there! 👋

I'm Luna, a hobby programmer from Germany.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind and java. My favorite tools are VSCode and Git.

I've got one pinned project yet...

I’ve built 1 public repo, but privately.. it’s just 6-7 side quests for my Linux System?

**Fun Facts:**
- I use Arch btw :3
- I can build some lines of code but I ask AI for structures to start coding (someone please teach me coding)
- I spent a lot more time into understanding arch linux than increasing my coding skills
