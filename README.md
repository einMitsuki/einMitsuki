Hey there!

I'm Luna, a hobby programmer from Germany.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are VSCode.

I've got no pinned projects yet...

I’ve built over 0 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 2? 

Fun Facts:
- I would say I am an amateur not a noob anymore xD
- I want to increase my coding skills (soon ig)
- Dr. Stone is my favourite Anime (I know it's BAD)
