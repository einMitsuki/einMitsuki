Hey there! 👋

I'm Luna, a hobby programmer from Germany.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind and java. My favorite tools are VSCode and Git.

I've got no pinned projects yet...

I’ve built over 0 public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 1? (it's 0 too) 

**Fun Facts:**
- I would say I am an amateur not a noob anymore xD
- I spent a lot more time into understanding linux than increasing my coding skills (probably lost even more time while trying to understand my french teacher xD)
- I want to increase my coding skills (soon ig)
- Dr. Stone is my favourite Anime (I know it's BAD)
